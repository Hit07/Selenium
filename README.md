AUTOMATION TESTING OF YAHOO SIGNUP PAGE USING SELENIUM

#SELENIUM #JAVA #TESTNG

In this project we are testing yahoo signup page using "Selenim" which is most widely used open source Web UI (User Interface) automation testing suite and we are generating report for the testcases using "TestNG" . We can easily come to know how many test cases are passed, failed, and skipped. This allows us  to execute the failed test cases separately.
